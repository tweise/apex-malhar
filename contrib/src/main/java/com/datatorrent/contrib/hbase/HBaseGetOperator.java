 * A base implementation of hbase input operator that retrieves tuples from HBase columns and provides get operation.&nbsp; Subclasses should provide implementation for get operation. <br>

 * This class provides a HBase input operator that can be used to retrieve tuples from columns in a

 * implement operationGet and getTuple methods. The operationGet method should provide a HBase Get metric
 * object that specifies where to retrieve tuples from a table. The getTuple method should map the contents
 * of a KeyValue from the Get result to a tuple.<br>
