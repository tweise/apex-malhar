/**
 * Library of arithmetic operators.
 * <br>
 * Most of the arithmetic operators come in three types based on their schema.
 * The operators whose names ends with "Map" (eg SumMap, MaxMap, MinMap) take in Map on input ports and emit HashMap. These operators use
 * round robin partitioning and would merge as per their functionality.
 * <br>  
 * The operators whose names ends with "KeyVal" (eg SumKeyVal, MaxKeyVal, MinKeyVal) take in KeyValPair and emit KeyValPair. These operators use
 * sticky key partitioning and would merge using default pass through merge operator.
 * <br>  
 * The operators whose names are just their function name (eg Sum, Min, Max) operate on same objects and emit a final result. These operators have no keys.
 * They partition in roundrobin and would merge as per their functionality.
 * <br>
 * Average, Quotient operators are non-partitionable.
