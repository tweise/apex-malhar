/**
 * Adds incoming tuple to the state and emits the result of each addition on the respective ports.

 * The addition would go on forever.Result is emitted on four different data type ports:floatResult,integerResult,longResult,doubleResult.
 * Input tuple object has to be an implementation of the interface Collection.Tuples are emitted on the output ports only if they are connected. 
 * This is done to avoid the cost of calling the functions when some ports are not connected.
 * This is a stateful pass through operator<br>
