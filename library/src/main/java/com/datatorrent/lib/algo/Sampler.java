/**
 * This operator takes a stream of tuples as input, and emits each tuple with a specified probability.
 * <p>
 * Emits the tuple as per probability of pass rate out of total rate. <br>
 * <br>
 * An efficient filter to allow sample analysis of a stream. Very useful is the incoming stream has high throughput.

 * <b> StateFull : No, </b> tuple is processed in current window. <br>
 * <b> Partitions : Yes. </b> No state dependency among input tuples. <br>
 * <b>Ports</b>:<br>
 * <b>data</b>: expects K<br>
 * <b>sample</b>: emits K<br>

 * <b>Properties</b>:<br>
 * <b>passrate</b>: Sample rate out of a total of totalrate. Default is 1<br>
 * <b>totalrate</b>: Total rate (divisor). Default is 100<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Specific compile time checks are</b>: None<br>
 * passrate is positive integer<br>
 * totalrate is positive integer<br>
 * passrate and totalrate are not compared (i.e. passrate &lt; totalrate) check is not done to allow users to make this operator a passthrough (all) during testing<br>
