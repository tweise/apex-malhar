/**
 * This is the base class used to represent AppData queries. App Data quries have the following features:
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <ul>
 *  <li><b>id:</b>This is the client id for the query. It is also the same id which is attached to results.</li>
 *  <li><b>countdown:</b>This is the number of times results are returned for the query. This is meant to allow
 *  the client to display updated data without incurring the latency of issuing a separate query for each update.</li>
 *  <li><b>schemaKeys:</b>This is used in the case where an operator responding to queries is hosting multiple schemas. When
 *  an operator is exposing multiple schemas, the schemakeys are used to select the schema that this query is intended to be
 *  run against.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This base class holds the basic setters and getters for manipulating and storing these query properies.
